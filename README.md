For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.

If you are unfamiliar with HTML tables, take a look at the docs with an example hereLinks to an external site.

Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

See a table of the transactions.
Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table no persistence mechanism is needed for this.
Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
Advanced Deliverables
These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to stretch your skills.

Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
